# Planespotter

Welcome to another home for the Planespotter application, a fully functional example cloud native application. The application is composes of five components, frontend, RESTful api, synchronizer, redis and mysql.  

The frontend and RESTful api are both written using the Python Flash microframework. The frontend presents content and the application manages the various connections. The sync funcationality is also written in Python and performs live data syncronizion of aircrafts that are currently airborne, this data is then cached in Redis. The MySQL database is populated at point of deployment with Aircraft data pulled from the FAA.

## Application Deployment

The  application can be deployed in a variety of architectures, the most simple is to [deploy each component as a virtual machine](https://github.com/darrylcauldwell/planeSpotters/tree/master/docs/VM-ALL.md).

## Network Communications

One of uses of the Planespotter app can be to demonstrate NSX features like micro-segmentation policies. The the app is build with this in mind and uses quick timeouts to show the impact of firewall rule changes and includes a 'healtcheck' function that reports back communication issues between the 'microservices' of the app.

Here's the Communication Matrix of the component amongst each other and to the external world:
